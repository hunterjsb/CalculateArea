# CSCI B550 - Project 1
Developed by Hunter Boyd
## About the Project
This project implements a simple class to estimate the area of an image - specifically PartyRockFire.jpeg.
This may work to estimate the area of other images, but it has been specifically tailored to this one.
	
## Dependencies
This project was developed using:
* Python version: 3.9.6
* numpy version: 1.21.2
* opencv-python version: 4.5.3.56
	
## Setup

To run this project, make sure `main.py`, `calculatearea.py`, and  `PartyRockFire.jpeg` are all in the same directory.

Next, install the dependencies using pip:

```
$ python -m pip install numpy
$ python -m pip install opencv-python
```

Then run main.py to calculate the area.
```
$ python main.py
```
